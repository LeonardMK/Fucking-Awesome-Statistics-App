# Fucking-Awesome-Statistics-App
This R-Shiny app intention is to implement the [University of Zurich's guideline
for statistical analysis](https://www.methodenberatung.uzh.ch/de.html) to get
an easy access tool for students or researchers with only minimum knowledge
of statistics and the corresponding tools. Because lets face it, you won't
take the time to get better in statistics anyway. So in order to improve the
quality of your papers I offer you a simple framework for performing the
appropriate analyses.
